		/// The <em>first line</em> defines the number of features in every sample of the data set.
		///
		/// The <em>following lines</em> are the samples (one sample per line). Every line has a number of fields according to the definition in the first line,
		///	which constitutes a feature vector, and one additional field that tells the class of the feature vector. An example of a valid data set may be:
		///
		/// 4<br>
		/// 0.1 0.3 1.3 2.4 3<br>
		/// 1.5 2.8 6.2 2.4 1<br>
		/// 3.3 1.2 0.9 1.1 3<br>
		/// . . .<br>
		///
		/// The <em>feature</em> fields must have a floating point format: both the integer and decimal parts are required and separated by a point.
		///	The <em>class</em> field must be an integer.
		///
		/// @param		filename	Path in the filesystem to the file containing the dataset.
