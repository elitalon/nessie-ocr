/// @brief		FeatureExtractor of the OCR process.
///
/// @details	This class encapsulates all the algorithms related to feature extraction stage of the OCR process. Its task is to capture the
///	distinctive characteristics of the digitized characters for recognition, i.e. the measurement of those attributes of patterns that are most
///	pertinent to a given classification task. In the very end of the process, an array of patterns is available through the
///	FeatureExtractor::patterns() method, and an array of feature vectors through the method FeatureExtractor::featureVectors() method.
