/// @brief Press clip of a newspaper page.
///
/// @details This class manages a press clip within a newspaper's page, storing it as a set of pixels from an underlying image that
/// representes the whole page. It is assumed that the origin of coordinates is located at the top leftmost pixel in the underlying
///	image, as well in the clip itself.
///
/// @details The newspaper pages are images that may come in several formats, such JPEG, PDF, PNG, etc. The Magick++ library (an API
///	for the ImageMagick suite) provides an abstraction layer to keep the code independent from the image format, so that other classes
///	have an unified way to work with images. In future modifications any other library can be added to load images. In such case, the
///	<em>constructor</em> and the writeToOutputImage method must be overloaded.
///
