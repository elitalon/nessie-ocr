/// @brief		Text extracted from a press clip during the recognition process.
///
///	@details	The text that comes in newspaper articles might have characters with accents and, in general, characters that do not belong
///	to the standard ASCII set. By default, the STL <em>string</em> class stores these special characters as if their size were two instead of one (e.g. a vocal plus
///	its accent). That's why this class handles an array of strings, rather than a simple <em>string</em> object.
