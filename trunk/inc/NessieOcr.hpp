/// @brief		Manager of the optical character recognition process.
///
/// @details	A pattern recognition system typically involves four stages: preprocessing, feature extraction, classification and postprocessing. This class
///	allows to manage the execution and outcomes of every stage, or apply a global character recognition over an input press clip. The execution of any stage
///	produces some statistical data that might be of interest.
///
/// @details	As the first important step, image and data <em>preprocessing</em> serves the purpose of extracting regions of interest, enhancing and cleaning up
/// the images, so that they can be directly and efficiently processed by the feature extraction stage.
///
///	@details	The purpose of <em>feature extraction</em> is the measurement of those attributes of patterns that are most pertinent to a given classification
///	task, producing a feature vector for each pattern extracted in the preprocessing stage.
///
///	@details	The <em>classification</em> stage processes the feature vectors to identify the characters. The feature vectors of input patterns are mapped onto
///	points in a feature space. Depending on the location of these points the patterns are classified as one character or another.
///
///	@details	In the end, <em>postprocessing</em> builds a meaningful text by inserting blank spaces between characters to separate the words.
