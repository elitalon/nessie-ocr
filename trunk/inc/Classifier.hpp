///	@brief		Classifier of the OCR process.
/// 
///	@details	This class represents the classification stage of the OCR process, providing an interface to encapsulate different classification paradigms.
///	Its task is to match every feature vector passed to its associated character. In the end of the process, a string of characters is available through the
///	Classifier::characters() method.
/// 
/// @see		ClassificationAlgorithm, ClassifierStatistics, FeatureVector, Dataset
///
///	@todo		Implement new paradigms of classification (neural networks, support vector machines,...).
