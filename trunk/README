* Installation hints

Here are a few hints which might help installing `NessieOCR' on your
system.

** ImageMagick.

NessieOCR uses the ImageMagick's C++ API to read and write image
files: Magick++. If you don't have the ImageMagick suite already, you
need to install them. The binaries and sources can be found at:

http://www.imagemagick.org/

ImageMagick has its own dependencies as well. Read carefully the
installation manual to make your installation of Magick++ can handle
your preferred image format.

** Boost library.

NessieOCR also uses some utilities provided by the Boost Library
distribution. If you don't have the Boost library already, you need to
install it. The binaries and sources can be found at:

http://www.boost.org/

** Databases.

During training stage the samples taken can be stored in different
ways. If you are planning to use a database you can use MySQL or
PostgreSQL. In such case you need to install the following libraries,
as they are used in `NessieOCR' to provide internal access to the
databases:

	Database	Driver		Website

	MySQL		MySQL++		http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/
	PostgreSQL	libpqxx		http://pqxx.org/development/libpqxx/

You should also read the package documentation to know the database
design requirements for NessieOCR.

* Bug reporting.

Send bug reports to <elitalon@gmail.com>.  A bug report should contain
an adequate description of the problem, your input, what you expected,
what you got, and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but they only
describe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to infer.
If needed, submit actual data files with your report.  Small data
files are preferred.  Big files may sometimes be necessary, but do not
send them to the report address; rather take special arrangement with
the mantainer.

Your feedback will help us to make a better and more portable package.
Consider documentation errors as bugs, and report them as such.  If
you develop anything pertaining to `NessieOCR' or have suggestions,
let us know and share your findings by writing to <elitalon@gmail.com>.
