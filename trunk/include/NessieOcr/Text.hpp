///	@details	This class stores a postprocessed text that has been recognized by NessieOcr and some associated atributes.
///	This text does not match the original text in the newspapers, since all the punctuation sign and miscellaneous characters are removed.
///	Simply put, this text is only composed of words separated by a single white space. This is done since this class is intended to be used
///	by an article classifier in a higher level.
