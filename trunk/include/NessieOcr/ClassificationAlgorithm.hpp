///	@details	This class declares an abstract class that allows the definition of multiple classification algorithms, so that
///	a set of feature vectors can be classified using several paradigms. A ClassificationAlgorithm object is declared internally
///	within the Classifier class, since it is not allowed to modify the algorithm of a Classifier object.
