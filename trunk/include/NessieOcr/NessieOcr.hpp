/// @brief		Manager of the optical character recognition process.
///
/// @details	A pattern recognition system typically involves four stages: preprocessing, feature extraction, classification and postprocessing. This class
///	inhibits a client program to manage the execution and outcomes of every stage. Instead, a common set of operations are provided to satisfy most clients. If it's not
///	enough for your needs, a client can always use directly each one of the subsystems that compose NessieOcr: preprocessing, feature extraction, classification and
/// postprocessing.
///
/// @details	As the first important step, image and data <em>preprocessing</em> serves the purpose of extracting regions of interest, enhancing and cleaning up
/// the images, so that they can be directly and efficiently processed by the feature extraction stage. This subsystem is managed through the Preprocessor class.
///
///	@details	The purpose of <em>feature extraction</em> is the measurement of those attributes of patterns that are most pertinent to a given classification
///	task, producing a feature vector for each pattern extracted in the preprocessing stage. This subsystem is managed through the FeatureExtractor class.
///
///	@details	The <em>classification</em> stage processes the feature vectors to identify the characters. The feature vectors of input patterns are mapped onto
///	points in a feature space. Depending on the location of these points the patterns are classified as one character or another. This subsystem is managed through
/// the Classifier class and its derived classes. As you can see below, a Classifier object is actually a parameter you should specify in NessieOcr's constructor.
///
///	@details	In the end, <em>postprocessing</em> builds a meaningful text by inserting blank spaces between characters to separate the words. Management of this
///	subsystem is not supported currently.
///
/// @see		Statistics, Preprocessor, FeatureExtractor, Classifier
///
///	@todo		Improve the usability of supervised training methods.
///	@todo		Create a namespace and avoid access to private classes.
