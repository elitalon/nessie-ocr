///	@brief		Set of pixels that defines a pattern to be recognized as a character in classification stage.
///
///	@details	A pattern is a matrix of binary pixels that represents a character found in the preprocessing stage. Thus, it is composed of ink pixels,
///	and a number of background pixels to fill the holes in the matrix that do not belong to the character. Every pattern has a fixed size, since a
///	pre-requisite for an optimal classification is that patterns must be normalized to constant width and height.
