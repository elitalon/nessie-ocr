///	@brief		Classifier of the OCR process.
///
///	@details	This class represents the classification stage of NessieOcr, providing an interface to encapsulate different classification paradigms.
///	When performing a classification, its task is to match every feature vector passed to the most probably character. When performing a training, its task is
/// to compare the classified characters with a reference text, fixing the wrong decisions.
///
/// @see		ClassificationAlgorithm, ClassifierStatistics, FeatureVector, Text
///
///	@todo		Implement new paradigms of classification (neural networks, support vector machines,...).
