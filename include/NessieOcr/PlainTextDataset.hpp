///	@brief		Dataset built by retrieving the data from a plain text file in the filesystem.
///
///	@details	The file must provide the information about samples according to the following format. The first line must be a single number
///	that defines the number of features stored, i.e. the number of fields that every feature vector must have. Then, the following lines are
///	the samples themselves, with one sample per line. Every sample must have exactly a number of fields according to the definition in the first
///	line, and then and additional number that tells the class where the feature vector belongs to.
/// The <em>feature</em> fields must have a floating point format: both the integer and decimal parts are required and separated by a point.
///	The <em>class</em> field must be an integer. An example of a valid data set could be this:
///
/// @code
/// 4
/// 0.1 0.3 1.3 2.4 3
/// 1.5 2.8 6.2 2.4 1
/// 3.3 1.2 0.9 1.1 3
/// 0.1 0.3 1.3 2.4 3
